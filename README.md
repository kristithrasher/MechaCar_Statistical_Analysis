# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![linearRegressionModeldeliv1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94208810/155904136-0e49a4ae-9ba4-46d1-b6b5-41c1bee707de.png)

After performing linear regression the variables that provided a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were the vehicle_length and ground_clearance. These two variables have significant impact on the mpg(miles per gallon). 
Each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability of each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model. 
Summary of Linear Regression Model
r-sqared = 0.7149033
p-value = 5.35e-11
Summary of Linear Regression Model shows the r-squared (r2) value represents how well the regression model approximates real-world data points. In this case the r2 value is 0.714 and means that roughly, 71% of the variablilty of our dependent variable (mpg) is explained using this linear model.
The p-value(probability value) of our linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11. 

##  Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
![total_summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94208810/155906033-f96706d3-5e0e-43bb-b9bb-a8a671d94a6c.png)
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. The Variance of the suspension coils according to our total_summary statistics show variance of 62.299356.

![lot_summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94208810/155905856-1e1e4dd2-c860-4279-93eb-49c13989e21e.png)

As a whole it does meet design specifications in total but when broken down for each lot it shows lot 3 exceeds the design specification with a variance of 170.29 and therefore shows Lot1 and Lot2 do meet design specifications of having variance of less than 100 pounds per square inch. 

## T-Test on Suspension Coils
Performed t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.  I used the t.test() function to determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch(PSI).
The one sample t-test compared the mean of the dataset to the required PSI of 1500. 
Null Hypothesis: The mean = 1500.
Alternative Hypotheses: The mean is !=(not equal) to 1500.
The sample t-test shows that we pass our null hypothesis with the sample data with a p-value that is greater than our level of significance of .05.

H0 : There is no statistical difference between the two observed sample means. The mean is equal to 1500.
Ha : There is a statistical difference between the two observed sample means. The mean is not equal to 1500.

Lot 1 and Lot Lot 2 are showing p-values greater than .05, but lot 3 shows a p-value of .04 and is less than our level of significance and therefore our null hypothesis failed for lot 3. For Lot 1 and 2 t-tests show the p-level is higher than .05 so we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The means are statistically different.
So Lot 1 and 2 null hypothesis is true and for lot 3 null hypothesis is false with alternative hypothesis of Mean != 1500 is true. 


##  Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Statistical stucdy that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. 
Is there a diffence in the safety rating for MechaCars and Other Cars (Competition)?
Calculate the safety rating mean for MechaCars and for Competion cars. 
The metric I would like to test would be the safety rating for each car type (MechaCar and Competition)

Null Hypothesis: There is no statistical difference in safety rating for MechaCar and Competition Cars.

Alternative Hypothesis: There is a statistical difference in safety rating for MechaCar and Competition Cars. 

The statistical test I would you use to test the hypothesis would be the Two-Sample
t-Test because I am trying to determine Is there a statistical difference
between the distribution means (MechaCars and Competition Cars). 
from two samples. 

I would pair my data (competition data and MechCar data) and  determine if there is a statistical difference in overall safety ratings between vehicles from MechaCar or Competition. Checking to see the mean difference. 
I would look at the p-value and see if it is above the assumed significance level. Based on P-value and level of significance I would determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not and determine if their is a significant difference in safety ratings between vehicles manufactured from MechaCar and Competitors.
